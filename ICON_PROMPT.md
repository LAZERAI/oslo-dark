- ✅ Use the Oslo Dark color scheme
- ✅ Create a gradient (shows sophistication)

---

## 🎯 VISUAL GUIDELINES

### Size Considerations
```
At 256x256:  Should be clearly visible and beautiful
At 128x128:  Should still be recognizable and proportional
At 64x64:    Should be clear and distinct
At 48x48:    Should be recognizable (critical!)
At 32x32:    Basic shape should be evident
```

### Contrast & Clarity
- Ensure sufficient contrast between elements
- Main shape should "pop" from background
- Gradient should flow naturally
- No thin lines that become invisible at small sizes

### Color Harmony
- Primary color: #1e3a5f (should dominate)
- Secondary color: #82a5b9 (accent/gradient)
- Highlight: #c8f0fa (sparingly for accents)
- Background: Transparent or implied #1a1a1a
